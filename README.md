| Area         | Technologies                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | **Next.js** and **React** for the core framework, **TypeScript** for type safety, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Framer Motion** for animations, and **Shadcn/ui** for accessible components. |
| **Backend** | The AI chatbot is powered by a **Python** backend using **Flask** and **Gunicorn**. The frontend interacts with it through **Next.js API Routes** which act as a proxy.                               |
| **AI/ML** | The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain for the chatbot is built with **LangChain**. It uses **Hugging Face Transformers** for embeddings, **FAISS** for the vector store, and the **Groq API** for fast LLM inference.                                            |
| **Deployment**| The entire application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Vercel**, which handles both the Next.js frontend and the Python serverless backend seamlessly. |
